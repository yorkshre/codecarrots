Strings formatting
==================

The last issue which we have mentioned above was the problem with too many digits in a printed BMI.
Out of the three problems we had, this one is the easiest to solve.

That’s why we left it for the end of our "adventure" with the BMI calculator. We already know
that we can add strings to each other and multiply them by integers. You will see that we can also
format them. But first we will need one more type of data (except the strings and the numbers we
already know).


.. _bmi-tuples:

Tuples
------

At the beginning we mentioned that we can not use commas in numbers, because we will need them later
while using tuples. And here they are:

    >>> 1, 2, 3
    (1, 2, 3)
    >>> ("Ala", 15)
    ('Ala', 15)
    >>> x = 1,5
    >>> print(x)
    (1, 5)

A tuple is nothing more than a few values grouped into one. The values we want to group should be
separated by commas. The whole thing can be enclosed in parentheses to make it more clear, but it is
not required. Except when we want to group none of the elements (however strange it may sound):

    >>> ()
    ()

Tuples can be combined:

    >>> names = ("Paulina", "Kowalska")
    >>> details = (27, 1.70)
    >>> names + details
    ('Paulina', 'Kowalska', 27, 1.7)

They may also contain other tuples e.g. information on a point on the map can be
grouped as follows:

    >>> point = ("Name of point", (x, y))

where ``x`` and ``y`` are numbers.

We can refer to the grouped values by using their positions in the tuple (counting form zero) e.g.:

    >>> p = (10, 15)
    >>> p[0]  #  first value
    10
    >>> p[1]  # second value
    15


Formatting plain
--------------------

Going back to our program: currently the result is reduced to a single line. Now we want to write the
BMI as a number and the interval in which it is located, that is to say::

    Your BMI is equal: 21.39 (normal weight)

Modify the current program so that the calculated BMI would be available under the name of ``bmi``,and
the name of the interval under the name of ``category``. Then we can use :func:`print` and obtain the
required result:

.. testsetup::

    bmi = 21.387755102040817
    category = "normal weight"

.. testcode::

    print("Your BMI is equal:", bmi, "(" + category + ")")

.. testoutput::
    :hide:

    Your BMI is equal: 21.387755102040817 (normal weight)

Well, almost….We still have too many digits. We would also have a problem if we wanted to generate
such a string and save with a name, because we use :func:`print` to separate the elements.
Fortunately, there is a better way:

    >>> bmi = 21.387755102040817
    >>> category = "normal weight"
    >>> result = "Your BMI: %f (%s)" % (bmi, category)
    >>> result
    'Your BMI: 21.387755 (normal weight)'
    >>> print(result)
    Your BMI: 21.387755 (normal weight)

We have here a string and a tuple joined by ``%``. The string is a template which will be completed
with values from the tuple. The spaces to be filled are also labeled with the percentage (``%``). .
The letter that follows defines the type of a value we want to insert. The integers are represented
by  ``i`` as **integer** (we can also use ``d`` as **decimal**),  strings are represented by ``s`` as
**string**, and floating-point numbers are represented by ``f`` for **float**:

    >>> "String: %s, Numbers: %d %f" % ("Ala", 10, 3.1415)
    'String: Ala, Numbers: 10 3.141500'

Now instead of nine decimal places we always get six, but the formatting has the advantage that it
allows us to have more control by putting between ``%`` and ``f`` additional information, e.g. if you
want to display only two places after the decimal point:


    >>> "%.2f" % 3.1415
    '3.14'
    >>> "%.2f" % 21.387755102040817
    '21.39'

There are plenty options of formatting, so we will not show them all here. One of the most useful is
the option of aligning to a specific number of characters:

.. testcode::

    WIDTH = 28

    print("-" * WIDTH)
    print("| Name and last name |  Weight  |")
    print("-" * WIDTH)
    print("| %15s | %6.2f |" % ("Łukasz", 67.5))
    print("| %15s | %6.2f |" % ("Pudzian", 123))
    print("-" * WIDTH)

.. testoutput::

    --------------------------------
    | Name and last name  |  Weight|
    --------------------------------
    |              Łukasz |  67.50 |
    |             Pudzian | 123.00 |
    --------------------------------

We can also align the string ``-``  to the left by putting before the number of characters:

.. testcode::

    WIDTH = 28

    print("-" * WIDTH)
    print("| Name and last name |  Weight |")
    print("-" * WIDTH)
    print("| %-15s | %6.2f |" % ("Łukasz", 67.5))
    print("| %-15s | %6.2f |" % ("Pudzian", 123))
    print("-" * WIDTH)

.. testoutput::

    -------------------------------
    | Name and last name|  Weight |
    -------------------------------
    | Łukasz            |  67.50  |
    | Pudzian           | 123.00  |
    -------------------------------

Aligning towards the centre is an additional exercise for you :).


Formatting more Pythonic way

Methods
=======

With string there is a lot of methods implemented already.

1. capitalize() - Capitalizes first letter of string
2. count(str, beg= 0,end=len(string)) - Counts how many times str occurs in string or in a substring of string if starting index beg and ending index end are given.
3. endswith(suffix, beg=0, end=len(string)) - Determines if string or a substring of string (if starting index beg and ending index end are given) ends with suffix; returns true if so and false otherwise.
4. find(str, beg=0 end=len(string)) - Determine if str occurs in string or in a substring of string if starting index beg and ending index end are given returns index if found and -1 otherwise.
5. index(str, beg=0, end=len(string)) - Same as find(), but raises an exception if str not found.
6. isalnum() - Returns true if string has at least 1 character and all characters are alphanumeric and false otherwise.
7. isalpha() - Returns true if string has at least 1 character and all characters are alphabetic and false otherwise.
8. isdigit() - Returns true if string contains only digits and false otherwise.
9. islower() - Returns true if string has at least 1 cased character and all cased characters are in lowercase and false otherwise.
10. isnumeric() - Returns true if a unicode string contains only numeric characters and false otherwise.
11. isspace() - Returns true if string contains only whitespace characters and false otherwise.
12. istitle() - Returns true if string is properly "titlecased" and false otherwise.
13. isupper() - Returns true if string has at least one cased character and all cased characters are in uppercase and false otherwise.
14. join(seq) - Merges (concatenates) the string representations of elements in sequence seq into a string, with separator string.
15. len(string) - Returns the length of the string
16. lower() - Converts all uppercase letters in string to lowercase.
17. lstrip() - Removes all leading whitespace in string.
18. max(str) - Returns the max alphabetical character from the string str.
19. min(str) - Returns the min alphabetical character from the string str.
20. replace(old, new [, max]) - Replaces all occurrences of old in string with new or at most max occurrences if max given.
21. rfind(str, beg=0,end=len(string)) - Same as find(), but search backwards in string.
22. rindex( str, beg=0, end=len(string)) - Same as index(), but search backwards in string.
23. rstrip() - Removes all trailing whitespace of string.
24. split(str="", num=string.count(str)) - Splits string according to delimiter str (space if not provided) and returns list of substrings; split into at most num substrings if given.
25. splitlines( num=string.count('\n')) - Splits string at all (or num) NEWLINEs and returns a list of each line with NEWLINEs removed.
26. startswith(str, beg=0,end=len(string)) - Determines if string or a substring of string (if starting index beg and ending index end are given) starts with substring str; returns true if so and false otherwise.
27. strip([chars]) - Performs both lstrip() and rstrip() on string
28. swapcase() - Inverts case for all letters in string.
29. title() - Returns "titlecased" version of string, that is, all words begin with uppercase and the rest are lowercase.
30. upper() - Converts lowercase letters in string to uppercase.

There is over 10 more methods but they are much more advanced.

Exercises
-------------------

Obligatory task
-------------------

Type in interpreter:

    >>> import antigravity

This is very important library use it wise :)

Method play ground
-------------------

Create a string and use all methods mentioned above.

Method play ground level 2: Combining string methods
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Try to use methods as a chain reaction.

Palindrome
-------------------
Write (if You can in one line) if the world is a palindrome - a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.
For example

- kayak
- mr owl ate my metal worm.
- go hang a salami Im a lasagna hog.


Summary
-------------------

We also know now that indentations can be important, especially when we want to use
the instruction :keyword:`if` (also in connection with :keyword:`else` and :keyword:`elif`).

This is quite a lot like for a first program. We still have a lot of work, anyhow you can be proud of
what we have done so far!

And if You did the obligatory task 1 You know there are some easter eggs in python and thats not all of them.
Here is one more:

    >>> True + True

:-)
