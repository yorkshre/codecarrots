Flask: Templates
======================================

Why we need templates
------------------------
Let's consider how we can expand our little application.

We want the home page of our app to have a heading that welcomes the logged in user, that's pretty standard for applications of this kind. Ignore for now the fact that we have no way to log a user in, I'll present a workaround for this issue in a moment.

An easy option to output a nice and big heading would be to change our view function to output HTML, maybe something like this:

.. code-block:: python


    from app import app

    @app.route('/')
    @app.route('/index')
    def index():
        user = {'nickname': 'Martha'}  # fake user
        return '''
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Home Page</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Hello, ''' + user['nickname'] + '''</h1>
      </body>
    </html>
    '''


Give the application a try to see how this looks in your browser.

Since we don't have support for users yet I have resorted to using a placeholder user object, sometimes called fake or mock object. This allows us to concentrate on certain aspects of our application that depend on parts of the system that haven't been built yet.

I hope you agree with me that the solution used above to deliver HTML to the browser is very ugly. Consider how complex the code will become if you have to return a large and complex HTML page with lots of dynamic content. And what if you need to change the layout of your web site in a large app that has dozens of views, each returning HTML directly? This is clearly not a scalable option.

Templates to the rescue
------------------------
If you could keep the logic of your application separate from the layout or presentation of your web pages things would be much better organized, don't you think? You could even hire a web designer to create a killer web site while you code the site's behaviors in Python. Templates help implement this separation.

Let's write our first template file app/templates/index.html:

.. code-block:: html


    <html>
      <head>
        <title>{{ title }} - App</title>
      </head>
      <body>
          <h1>Hello, {{ user.nickname }}!</h1>
      </body>
    </html>


As you see above, we just wrote a mostly standard HTML page, with the only difference that there are some placeholders for the dynamic content enclosed in {{ ... }} sections.

Now let's see how we use this template from our view function (file app/views.py):

from flask import render_template

.. code-block:: python


    @app.route('/')
    @app.route('/index')
    def index():
        user = {'nickname': 'Martha'}  # fake user
        return render_template('index.html', title='Home', user=user)


Try the application at this point to see how the template works. Once you have the rendered page in your browser you may want to view the source HTML and compare it against the original template.

To render the template we had to import a new function from the Flask framework called render_template. This function takes a template filename and a variable list of template arguments and returns the rendered template, with all the arguments replaced.

Under the covers, the render_template function invokes the Jinja2 templating engine that is part of the Flask framework. Jinja2 substitutes {{...}} blocks with the corresponding values provided as template arguments.

Control statements in templates
------------------------------------------------
The Jinja2 templates also support control statements, given inside {%...%} blocks. Let's add an if statement to our template (file app/templates/index.html):

.. code-block:: html

    <html>
      <head>
        {% if title %}
        <title>{{ title }} - App</title>
        {% else %}
        <title>Welcome to The App</title>
        {% endif %}
      </head>
      <body>
          <h1>Hello, {{ user['nickname'] }}!</h1>
      </body>
    </html>


Now our template is a bit smarter. If the view function forgets to define a page title then instead of showing an empty title the template will provide its own title. Feel free to remove the title argument in the render_template call of our view function to see how the conditional statement works.

Loops in templates
---------------------
The logged in user in our App application will probably want to see some lists, so let's see how we can do that.

Lets thing about a blog in that case.

.. code-block:: python


    @app.route('/')
    @app.route('/index')
    def index():
        user = {'nickname': 'Martha'}  # fake user
        posts = [  # fake array of posts
            {
                'author': {'nickname': 'John'},
                'title': 'Beautiful day in Poznan!'
                'body': 'Very random text about Poznan!'
            },
            {
                'author': {'nickname': 'Susan'},
                'title': 'The Avengers movie was so cool!'
                'body': 'Long random text about the movie!'
            }
        ]
        return render_template("index.html", title='Home', user=user, posts=posts)



To represent user posts we are using a list, where each element has author and body fields.
When we get to implement a real database we will preserve these field names, so we can design and test our template
using the fake objects without having to worry about updating it when we move to a database.

On the template side we have to solve a new problem. The list can have any number of elements,
it will be up to the view function to decide how many posts need to be presented.
The template cannot make any assumptions about the number of posts, so it needs to be prepared to render as many posts as the view sends.

So let's see how we do this using a for control structure (file app/templates/index.html):

.. code-block:: html


    <html>
      <head>
        {% if title %}
        <title>{{ title }} - App</title>
        {% else %}
        <title>Welcome to the App</title>
        {% endif %}
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Hi, {{ user.nickname }}!</h1>

        {% for post in posts %}
        <div>
        <p>{{ post.author.nickname }} writs article with title: <b>{{ post.title }}</b></p></div>
        {% endfor %}

      </body>
    </html>


Simple, right? Give it a try, and be sure to play with adding more content to the posts array.

Template inheritance
------------------------------------------------


Our web application will need to have a navigation bar at the top of the page with a few links.
Here you will get the link to edit your profile, to login, logout, etc.

We can add a navigation bar to our index.html template, but as our application grows
we will be needing to implement more pages, and this navigation bar will have to be copied to all of them.
Then you will have to keep all these identical copies of the navigation bar in sync, and that could become a
 lot of work if you have a lot of pages and templates.

Instead, we can use Jinja2's template inheritance feature, which allows us to move the parts of the
page layout that are common to all templates and put them in a base template from which all other templates are derived.

So let's define a base template that includes the navigation bar and also the bit of title logic we implemented earlier (file app/templates/_base.html):

.. code-block:: html


    <html>
      <head>
        {% if title %}
        <title>{{ title }} - App</title>
        {% else %}
        <title>Welcome to the App</title>
        {% endif %}
      </head>
      <body>
        <div>Microblog: <a href="/index">Home</a></div>
        <hr>

        {% block content %}
        {% endblock %}

      </body>
    </html>


In this template we use the block control statement to define the place where the derived templates can insert themselves. Blocks are given a unique name, and their content can be replaced or enhanced in derived templates.

And now what's left is to modify our index.html template to inherit from _base.html (file app/templates/index.html):

.. code-block:: html


    {% extends "_base.html" %}
    {% block content %}
        <h1>Hi, {{ user.nickname }}!</h1>
        {% for post in posts %}
        <div><p>{{ post.author.nickname }} says: <b>{{ post.body }}</b></p></div>
        {% endfor %}
    {% endblock %}

Since the _base.html template will now take care of the general page structure we have removed those elements
from this one and left only the content part. The extends block establishes the inheritance link between the two templates,
so that Jinja2 knows that when it needs to render index.html it needs to include it inside base.html. The two templates have
matching block statements with name content, and this is how Jinja2 knows how to combine the two into one. When we get to write new
templates we will also create them as extensions to _base.html.
